# Audio Transcriber

A beginner-friendly Python tool that converts audio files into text using OpenAI's Whisper model. Perfect for those who want to start their journey in audio processing!

## What Does This Tool Do?

This tool helps you convert spoken words from audio files into written text. It's like having a super-smart assistant that listens to audio and writes down everything it hears!

## Key Features

- üéµ Works with common audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A)
- üéØ High accuracy in converting speech to text
- üåç Supports multiple languages
- üíª Simple command line interface (don't worry, we'll explain how to use it!)
- üîí Clean project setup with virtual environment (we'll explain what this means)

## Before You Start (Prerequisites)

1. **Python**: You need Python 3.x installed on your computer
   - Not sure if you have Python? Open your terminal/command prompt and type: `python --version`
   - If you don't have Python, download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **pip**: The Python package installer (usually comes with Python)
   - To check if you have pip, run: `pip --version`

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Download the Project**
   ```bash
   # Clone this repository (copy all the files to your computer)
   git clone <repository-url>
   
   # Go into the project folder
   cd transcriber
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (like a clean room for your project)
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment:
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   After activation, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal line

3. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   # Install all the tools this project needs
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Basic Usage**
   ```bash
   # Format:
   python transcribe.py <path-to-your-audio-file>
   
   # Example:
   python transcribe.py my_recording.mp3
   ```

2. **Real Examples**
   ```bash
   # Transcribe an MP3 file
   python transcribe.py audio/interview.mp3
   
   # Transcribe a WAV file
   python transcribe.py audio/lecture.wav
   
   # Transcribe an M4A file
   python transcribe.py audio/voice_note.m4a
   ```

## Supported Audio Formats

- **MP3** (.mp3) - Most common audio format
- **WAV** (.wav) - High-quality audio format
- **M4A** (.m4a) - Common format for voice recordings

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **"Command not found: python"**
   - Make sure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH
   - Try using `python3` instead of `python`

2. **"No module named 'whisper'"**
   - Make sure you activated the virtual environment
   - Try reinstalling requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **"Audio file not found"**
   - Check if the audio file path is correct
   - Make sure you're in the right directory
   - Use the full path to the audio file if needed

4. **Virtual Environment Issues**
   - If `venv` command not found: `python -m pip install virtualenv`
   - If activation fails, check if you're in the project directory

## Key Terms Explained

- **Virtual Environment**: A clean, isolated space for your Python project
- **pip**: Python's package installer - helps you add tools to your project
- **Command Line**: The text interface where you type commands
- **Repository**: The project's folder with all its files
- **PATH**: A system setting that helps your computer find programs

## Development Tips for Beginners

1. Always activate your virtual environment before working
2. Keep your Python and packages updated
3. Check error messages carefully - they often tell you what's wrong
4. Save audio files in supported formats (MP3, WAV, M4A)
